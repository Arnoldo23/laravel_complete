      <p class="text-md">
        <i>The Incredible Youth International (IYI) is a youth-led movement with the aim of empowering and grooming young people to become agents of positive change who embody the principles of humility and generosity in their spheres of influence.
           I.Y.I is a registered Ugandan non-governmental organization (NGO), that was founded in 2005 and registered on 25th July 2007.’’ 
          It has a large network of young people, in 60 countries who share and embody the core values of IYI. Currently, IYI works with youths in secondary schools and 
          tertiary institutions and out-of-school youths, across Uganda. These young people are from IYI youth clubs in over 1600 schools of operation and several youth groups for out-of-school youths. 
          The youths are between 12 and 35 years of age. Out-of-school youths include fresh graduates, young professionals, and youth with no formal education. In-school youth form the IYI clubs while the out-of-school youths form 
          youth groups of not more than 50 committed members per youth group. The youth groups identify areas of talent development. Funding is mobilized amongst the group members to run the projects. Outreaches to the formed youth clubs and groups are routinely conducted by IYI management, to support, empower, and direct the focused young minds to exploration and learning. IYI conducts youth exchange programs with international youths to share and learn from each other. 
          The youth teams are led by selected youth leaders from the groups and are mentored by identified suitable responsible persons
